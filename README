The following program will encrypt any plain text using a stream and block method when supplied with some kind of key.
It will also decrypt any cipher using a stream or block method when supplied with the same key that was used for encryption.

The program will exit with some kind of error message if any of the following cases are met:
	1. Any input file, minus the output file name, does not exist.
	2. If a cipher mode other than 'S' for stream, or 'B' for block is used, case sensitive.
	3. If a operation other than 'E' for encryption, or 'D' for decryption is used, case sensitive.
	4. Any more or less arugments other than the 5 that are needed, not counting the executable name.

Need to know: The included makefile makes an executable 'PA1'.

Examples of run time arguments:

Stream Encryption: <executable> S <plain text file> <output file name> <key file> E
Stream Decryption: <executable> S <plain text file> <output file name> <key file> D

Block Encryption: <executale> B <plain text file> <output file name> <key file> E
Block Decryption: <executale> B <plain text file> <output file name> <key file> D
